This repository contains the replication package for the paper (currently under submission):

**"SETBVE: Quality-Diversity Driven Exploration of Software Boundary Behaviors"**

SETBVE is a black-box **Boundary Value Exploration** framework that applies Quality-Diversity (QD) optimization to discover a wide spectrum of boundary behaviors. 

--- 

## Overview

This repository is organized into three main components:

- **data/**: Contains example data from SETBVE experimental runs.
- **framework/**: Includes the implementation of the SETBVE framework.
- **evaluation/**: Provides scripts used to compute and summarize statistics from experimental results after the runs.

Each **directory contains a dedicated README** with detailed explanations and instructions.
