# Replication Package for SETBVE framework

This repository contains the replication package for the paper (currently under submission to *ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology* (TOSEM)):

**"SETBVE: Quality-Diversity Driven Exploration of Software Boundary Behaviors"**

SETBVE is a black-box **Boundary Value Exploration** framework that applies Quality-Diversity (QD) optimization to discover a wide spectrum of boundary behaviors. 

## Overview

This repository is organized into three main components:

- **data/**: Contains example data from SETBVE experimental runs, including calculated statistics for each run.
- **framework/**: Includes the implementation of the SETBVE framework
- **evaluation/**: Provides scripts used to compute and summarize statistics from experimental results after the runs.

Each **directory contains a dedicated README** with detailed explanations and instructions.
