# Data Directory Overview

This directory provides sample data of boundary candidates generated by SETBVE framework.

---

## 📁 example_archive/

This folder captures detailed archive data organized by:

### 🔹 Tracer Configuration

- **`0%Tracer/`** – No tracing budget used.
- **`10%Tracer/`** – 10% of the exploration budget allocated to tracing.

### 🔹 Parent Selection Strategies

Each tracer folder contains one of the following strategies:

- **`Curiosity/`** – Selection proportionate to the curiosity score.
- **`Fitness/`** – Selection based on the program's derivative (fitness score).
- **`Uniform/`** – Uniform random selection from the archive.
- **`NoSelection/`** – No archive selection; only the `Sampler` is active (Explorer disabled).

### 🔹 Software Under Test (SUTs)

Each strategy folder includes subfolders for SUTs:

- **Common to all strategies:** `bmi`, `bytecount`, `date`, `circle`
- **Exclusive to `Uniform/`:** `cld`, `fld`, `fldmod1`, `max`, `power_by_squaring`, `tailjoin` (Julia Base functions)

### 🔹 Run Duration

Each SUT folder contains:

- **`30 seconds/`** – Short-run data
- **`600 seconds/`** – Long-run data

> **Note:** Only *one example run* per configuration, SUT, and duration is included due to space constraints. In the full study, each configuration was executed for *20 runs*. The complete dataset is available to download: [SETBVE dataset](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15364606) or can be regenerated using the [SETBVE framework](https://github.com/aksabina/SETBVE/tree/main/framework).

## 📊 Column Descriptions (`example_archive` CSV files)

Each CSV in `example_archive` logs details of boundary candidates with the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `bd_*` | Behavioral descriptors (e.g., `bd_in_length_total`, `bd_out_length_diff`). See manuscript for calculation details. |
| `boundary_rank` | `0` = program derivative is 1; `1` = program derivative is between 0 and 1; `2` = program derivative is 0 |
| `curiosity` | Resulting curiosity score after the full run |
| `fitness` | Absolute program derivative (see manuscript) |
| `fitness_max` | Maximum fitness observed for the archive cell across all runs |
| `fitness_ratio_max` | Relative Program Derivative (RPD) = fitness / fitness_max |
| `i1_*`, `i2_*` | Input arguments (input pair) |
| `output1`, `output2` | Outputs from executing SUT with the respective inputs |
